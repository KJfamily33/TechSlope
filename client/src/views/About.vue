          <p> PropertyUsage empowers investors to
            profitability by finding the best use for commercial real estate property. </p>
          <h1> Our Vision </h1>
          <p> PropertyUsage makes it easy for Business Decision
            Makers to evaluate a property's use based on factors such as
            traffic, demographics, income, tax incentives and

              <li>PropertyUsage Score Pro: a paying API that provides you with the details of how we came up with our PropertyUsage Score. We list all of the data we used so that you can make knowledgeable decisions.</li>
